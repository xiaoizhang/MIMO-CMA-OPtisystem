# MIMO

**MIMO**_技术可以采取 DP-QPSK 技术的码型，但似乎已经确定其带宽了，然而在本次仿真过程中，112G的DQPSK主带宽为56G，加上旁瓣为448G，根据很多论文提到的56G，我有理由怀疑可以去掉旁瓣试试结果。_

**加上滤波器之后: 通过波形确实看到串扰减小了，但是得到的码型仍然不行，说明滤波器可能把有用的波形滤除了。**

That *_really_* has to go.
Can't pick one? Let's use them `*_all_*`.

That's fan__freakin__tastic!

Don't pass generic ``Object``s to methods that accept ``String``s!
